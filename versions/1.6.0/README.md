# Step 6

- List is populated with content from the API.
- From here the user should implement the monster detail page.

This step contains many changes relative to the previous steps. 
Maybe it needs to be broken up a bit more.

1. Create layout view_monster_detail with a "Hello World" text layer.
2. Add query by id to table monster
3. Create new view called monster_detail, referencing table layout and query.
4. In the template cell_monster add a showView action that shows the newly created view.
5. Add remaining fields to DB table monster for more information.
6. Build out the detail layout by creating the necessary layer styles and layouts to be re-used.
