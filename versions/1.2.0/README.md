# Step 3

- Static List with one monster is implemented.
- From here, the user should isolate the static cell into a layout and re-use it with a second static monster.

Steps:
1. Create a new layout called cell_monster and move the container layer from the grid in view_monsters there.
 - Change constraint to fullSize
2. Use layout layer as grid child in view_monsters to display the layout.
