# Step 4

- A static list with two monsters is implemented.
- From here the user should create a table that statically holds the monster and use it as a datasource for the list.

Steps:
1. Create db_table folder and monster.json DB and its content filled with static data containing 2 monsters.
2. Remove static layout layers from grid in view_monsters and add an insert layer that shows data from query instead.
 - When creating insert. Also create template cell_monster and required query in DB table
