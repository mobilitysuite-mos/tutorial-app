## ðŸ§© Lesson Progression

The **Tutorial App** is organized into multiple versions, each one representing the state of the project at a specific point in the course. Every version builds upon the previous one, gradually introducing new features and concepts.  

This version-based structure makes it easy to:  
- Follow along step by step.  
- Revisit earlier stages of the project.  
- Jump directly into any lesson without having to complete the previous ones.  

All versions are included in the provided **mos.config**, ensuring you always start from the correct project state for each lesson.
